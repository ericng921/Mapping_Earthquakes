# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overiew of project:

The purpose of project is to gather data from GeoJSON on the web by our own API to visualize the earthquake data. We have added two more layers in the project: tectonic plates and major earthquake data.
We can easily visualize the tectonic plate boundaries on the map with a red line when we click the tectonic plates layer. We can also see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map by clicking on the major earthquake layer.

At the end of the project we add a 3rd map (Dark map) on our map.

## Resources

Data Source: [Earthquakes GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [Tectonic Plate GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json), [Earthquakes 4.5+ GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)

Software: Visual Studio Code 1.67.2, Leaflet 1.8, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## Result




As picture shown above, it is the street view with 3 layers





As picture shown above, it is the Satellite view with 3 layers





As picture shown above, it is the dark view with 3 layers
